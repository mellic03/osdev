our configuration is already clear and well-structured for the Limine bootloader, but there are a couple of improvements you can make to make it more scalable and maintainable, especially if you plan to include more files in the future.
Improved Configuration Example

timeout: 0

/ckos
    protocol: limine

    path: boot():/boot/ckos

    # Fonts modules grouped for easier management
    module_path: boot():/data/font-roboto-12.bmp
    module_string: font:roboto-12

    module_path: boot():/data/font-roboto-24.bmp
    module_string: font:roboto-24

    module_path: boot():/data/font-roboto-32.bmp
    module_string: font:roboto-32

Suggestions for Better Management

    Group and Prefix Module Strings: By prefixing the module strings (e.g., font:roboto-12), you make it easier for your kernel to identify modules by type, which could be useful if you include other kinds of assets like images or scripts in the future.

    Use Wildcards or a Loader Script (if supported): If your kernel can handle a wildcard or some batch method, you can simplify the configuration significantly. For example:

module_path: boot():/data/font-roboto-*.bmp
module_string: fonts

Then in your kernel, parse the files dynamically based on their names or contents.

Generate the Configuration Dynamically: Instead of manually listing each file, you can write a script that generates this configuration based on the files in your /data/ directory. This ensures the configuration stays in sync with the available files.

Example script (for a UNIX-like system):

    #!/bin/bash
    echo "timeout: 0" > limine.cfg
    echo "/ckos" >> limine.cfg
    echo "    protocol: limine" >> limine.cfg
    echo "    path: boot():/boot/ckos" >> limine.cfg

    for file in /data/font-roboto-*.bmp; do
        basename=$(basename "$file")
        font_name=${basename%%.*}  # Strip the extension
        echo "    module_path: boot():$file" >> limine.cfg
        echo "    module_string: font:${font_name}" >> limine.cfg
    done

    This ensures that your configuration is automatically updated whenever files are added or removed.

    Consider Version Control and Automation: If you frequently update these configurations, you might want to integrate them into a version control system (e.g., Git) and automate their deployment using a build script or CI/CD pipeline.

These improvements streamline your process and reduce the chances of errors as you expand the number of assets your kernel needs.
